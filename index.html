				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Born in April 26, 121 - Rome, Italy.</li>
					<li>Predecessor of <span><strong>Antoninus Pius.</strong></span></li>
					<li>He appointed <span><strong>Commodus</strong></span> his son, as his successor.</li>
					<li>Marcus showed enthusiasm for wrestling and boxing.</li>
					<li>He married her cousin, <span><strong>Faustina the Younger</strong></span>.</li>
					<li>In year 136, Marcus began his training in oratory.</li>
					<li>After Antoninus died in 161, The Senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title
						<span><em>imperator</em></span>.
					</li>
					<li>Like many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing
						disputes.</li>
					<li>The <span><strong>Antonine Plague</strong></span> started in Mesopotamia in 165 or 166 at the end of
						Lucius's campaign
						against the
						Parthians. The plague also spread through Eastern Han empire of China. "Fever, diarrhea and inflammation of
						the pharynx, along with dry or pustular eruptions of the
						skin after nine days" were among the symptoms. It is believed that the plague was
						<span><em>smallpox</em></span>.
					</li>
					<li>Marcus Aurelius died at the age of 58 on 17 March, 180 of uknown causes in his military quarters.</li>
					<li>Between 170 and 180, Marcus wrote his <span><strong>Meditations</strong></span> in greek as a source for
						his own
						guidance
						and self-improvement. He had a logical mind, and his notes were
						representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality.</li>
					<li>Marcus acquired the reputation of a <span><em>philosopher king</em></span> within his lifetime.</li>

			<h2><strong>Meditations</strong> is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from AD 161 to
				180, recording his private
				notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy. </h2>
			<p>They are basically the moral tenets of Stoicism, learned from Epictetus: <span
					class="meditation-details-span">the cosmos is a unity governed by an
					intelligence, and the human soul is a part of that divine intelligence and can therefore stand, if naked and
					alone, at least pure and undefiled, amid chaos and futility.</span></p>
			<p>Marcus was a statesman, perhaps, but one of no great calibre; nor was he really a sage.</p>
			<p>But his personal nobility and dedication survive the most remorseless scrutiny; he counted the cost
				obsessively,
				but he did not shrink from paying it.</p>
